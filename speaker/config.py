    **Speaker Identification API** helps you to identify a speaker from a short audio clip. ðŸš€

    You will be able to:

    * Identify the speaker
    * Verify if the speaker is in the DB
    * Add a speaker to the DB 
    * List the speakers in the DB
    * Reload the DB
    * Restore the centroids file
    * delete a speaker
